      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>The following tutorial is ment to be a introduction to Arduino programming. It is designed in a way so the students can learn first the basics of electronics to understand the circuits that we will need.
        <p>After introducing the electronic components and their basic usage circuits, we will introduce the Arduino board and it is programming basics.</p>
        <p>Last, a problem will be presented to guide the tutorial: an Elevator. This tutorial will guide you through the circuit and the programming of it.</p>
        <p>Along this page, you will find Warning, tips, and <i>Do It Yourself</i> sections. You will identify them based on the box styles</p>
        <div class="warning box">
          <span><b>WARNING:</b> The LED will only turn on if the electricity flows in the right direction. If it does not turn on, try inverting the connectors</span>
        </div>
        <div class="tip box">
          <span><b>TIP:</b> The LED will only turn on if the electricity flows in the right direction. If it does not turn on, try inverting the connectors</span>
        </div>
        <div class="diy box">
          <span><b>HANDS ON:</b> It is time to build your first circuit. Find a LED, a 1k ressistor, a battery and some wires and let the LED shine!</span>

        <code>
// the setup function runs once when you press reset or power the board
void setup() {
  // initialize digital pin LED_BUILTIN as an output.
  pinMode(LED_BUILTIN, OUTPUT);
}

// the loop function runs over and over again forever
void loop() {
  digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, HIGH);   // turn the LED on (HIGH is the voltage level)
  delay(1000);                       // wait for a second
  digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, LOW);    // turn the LED off by making the voltage LOW
  delay(1000);                       // wait for a second
