      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>The following tutorial is meant to be a introduction to Arduino programming. It is designed in a way so students can learn first the basics of electronics to understand the circuits and then build a model themelves.
        <p>After introducing the electronic components and their basic usage circuits, we will introduce the Arduino board and it is programming basics.</p>
        <p>Last, a problem will be presented to guide the tutorial: an Elevator. This tutorial will guide you through the circuit and the programming of it.</p>
        <p>Along this page, you will find Warning, tips, and <i>Do It Yourself</i> sections. You will identify them based on the box styles</p>
        <div class="warning box">
          <span><b>WARNING:</b> The LED will only turn ON if the electricity flows in the right direction. If it does not turn ON, try inverting the connectors</span>

      <h1>Electronic components</h1>
        <p>Before starting our project, we need to know the basics of some electronic components that we will use in this tutorial. The first one we will talk about is the Battery. </p>
        <h2>Power supliers</h2>
        <p>Every circuit needs electricity to work. Electric current (electricity) are electrons moving through the wires and components of a circuit. Electricity can travell trough wires, and electronic components, but can not go through air or plastic. Its measured in <b>ampere (A)</b>. </p>
        <p>In order to be able to have electricity we need a source of power. Simplifying a lot what a battery is, lets consider it as bunch of electrons willing to go from one end of it to the other. Once all electrons had travell from one end to the other, the baterry is drained.</p>
        <p>The batteries work as power supliers and among different cualities they have, one important for our objective here is their <i>potential</i>.</p>
        <p><i>Potential</i> is measured in <b>volt (V)</b>. Normally comercial batteries are 1.5V (left), or 9V (middle). The symbol in the right corresponds to the normal representation of a battery in a circuit schematic.</p>

        </div>
        <p></p>
        <h2>Resistors</h2>
        <p>If not limited, the electric current can be very high and damage the components in your circuit or drain the battery very soon. Resistors present resistance (R) to the current and limit it. Depending on the resistor resistance value, how much it limits the current. The resistance is measured in <b>Ohm (Î©)</b>.</p>
        <p>Left image are comercial resistors, and on the right its normal schematic representation.</p>

      <pre>
        <code>
// the setup function runs once when you press reset or power the board
void setup() {
  // initialize digital pin LED_BUILTIN as an output.
  pinMode(LED_BUILTIN, OUTPUT);
}

// the loop function runs over and over again forever
void loop() {
  digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, HIGH);   // turn the LED on (HIGH is the voltage level)
  delay(1000);                       // wait for a second
  digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, LOW);    // turn the LED off by making the voltage LOW
  delay(1000);                       // wait for a second
